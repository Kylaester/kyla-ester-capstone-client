## Lessons Learned

Through my experience, I confronted the challenge of juggling multiple tasks within limited time constraints. This taught me the importance of prioritization and the need to streamline my efforts effectively. Moreover, I discovered the value of thinking outside the box when encountering difficulties in getting my functions to work. Instead of succumbing to discouragement, I embraced a creative mindset, exploring innovative solutions and remaining resilient. This journey has not only enhanced my time management skills but also reinforced the significance of perseverance and adaptability. I now approach challenges with a more organized and resilient mindset, ready to overcome any obstacles that come my way.

## Next Steps

Moving forward, the next crucial steps involve implementing a shop feature that allows users to utilize their earned points to purchase adorable characters, stylish clothes, and various items to personalize their cute characters. Additionally, it is essential to incorporate a check-in screen, fulfilling the original plan and further enhancing the user experience. By adding these features, the platform will offer an engaging and rewarding environment that encourages continued participation and creativity.
